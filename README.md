# Simulation-of-underwater-motion-and-search-of-a-lost-cylindrical-submarine
A collection of simulated cylindrical submarine codes, generated probabilistic landing codes, special A* search methods, and realistic search codes
Among them, Coculate.py is the original model, FinalRet.py is the model after adding the function of underwater scrolling, LookingFor.py is used to draw the search matrix, and two TestSearch.py can generate the search scheme in the score matrix. Translation.py can apply the saved search matrix to a specific sea simulation search.
Both GEBCO_2020.nc and oscar_currents_interim_20200101.nc are downloaded data with annotations written by gpt
